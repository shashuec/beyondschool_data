To refer to someone else or \r something else, a personal pronoun, like me, you, him, her, it, us or them, should be \r used instead.\r Example - Jake wrote a note for himself.\r The reflexive pronoun, himself, refers back to the subject, Jake.\r \r Example -Jake wrote a note for him.\r The personal pronoun, him, must refer to someone other than the subject, Jake.",
