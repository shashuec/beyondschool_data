It is usually missing a subject or a verb.\r Example - Knows the answer.\r This is a sentence fragment. It is missing a subject.\r Who knows the answer? She knows the answer.\r \r Example -The bright red car.\r This is a sentence fragment. It is missing a verb.\r What did the bright red car do? The bright red car stopped.\r \r A <b> run-on sentence </b> also called a <b> run-together sentence </b>, \r is made up of two sentences that should stand alone.\r Example - I knocked on the door it opened.\r To fix a run-on sentence, separate it into two sentences. \r Add a full stop after the first sentence, and use a capital letter at the \r beginning of the second sentence.\r Example - I knocked on the door.
